\begin_layout Chapter
Intro
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An introduction t othe principal ideas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Projective geometry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Straightness is preserved, the most general requirement on the mapping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Euclidean space, parallel lines do not meet.
 By adding an infinity point to a Euclidean space, projective space is introduce
d, an extension of euclidean space in which two lines always meet in a point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Points are represented by 
\emph on
equivalence classes
\emph default
 of coordinate triples, where two triples are equivalent when they differ
 by a common multiple, called 
\emph on
homogeneous coordinates.

\emph default
 Given a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,0\right)$
\end_inset

, divide by the last coordinate, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x/0,y/0\right)$
\end_inset

 is the point at infinity.
 The Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 can be extended to a project space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}^{n}$
\end_inset

 by representing poitns at homogenous vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Homogeneity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In classiclal Euclidean geometry all points are the same, no distringuished
 point.
 From the point of view of projective geometry, points at infinity are not
 any different from other points.
 By analogy of 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Euclidean transformation"
target "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, a projective transformation of projective space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}^{n}$
\end_inset

 is defined by a linear transformation of homogeneous coordinates
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X^{'}=H_{\left(n+1\right)\times\left(n+1\right)}X.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In CV problems, projective space is used as convenient way of repressenting
 the real 3D world.
 In reality, the real world and images of it do not contain points at infinity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Affine geometry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parallelism is not a concept of projective geometry, since all lines in
 projective space meet at some point.
 Parallel lines are just lines that intersect at points at infinity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The geometry of the proejctive plane and a distinguished line is known as
 
\emph on
affine geometry
\emph default
 and any projective transformation that maps the distringuished line in
 one space to the distinguished line of the other space is known as an 
\emph on
affine transformation
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Euclidean geometry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Singling out some special feature of the line or plane at infinity affine
 geometry becomes Euclidean geometry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Camera Projections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usual way of modelling the drop form 3D world to a 2D image is by 
\emph on
central projection
\emph default
 in which a ray from a point in space is drawn from a 3D world point through
 a fixed point in space, called the 
\emph on
center of project
\emph default
.
 All rays intersect a specific plane in space chosen as the 
\emph on
image plane
\emph default
.
 Central projection is simply a map from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}^{3}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All points in a ray passing through the center of projection project to
 the same point in an image.
 Thus, the set of all image points is the same as the set of rays through
 the camera center.
 The set of rays themselves may be thought of as a representation of the
 image space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 All that is important is the camera center.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part
Projective Geometry, Transformations and Estimation

The ideas of notation of projective geometry are central to an analysis
 of multiple view geometry.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main geometric ideas and notation that are required to understand the
 main material.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A significant advantage of the algebraic approach to geometry is that results
 derived in this way may more easily be used to derive algorithms and practical
 computational methods.

\end_inset

 , except 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,0,0\right)^{T}$
\end_inset

, which is not a line, is a representative of the equivalence class of lines.
 The set of equivalence classes of vectors in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}-\left(0,0,0\right)^{T}$
\end_inset

 forms the projective space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}^{2}$

It is easy to see that for a point

 and a line 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{l}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left(kx,ky,k\right)\boldsymbol{l}=0$
\end_inset

 iff 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,1\right)\boldsymbol{l}=0$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The points with last coordinate

\emph default
, or 
\emph on
points at infinity, written as 
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_inset Formula $l_{\infty}=\left(0,0,1\right)^{T}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a line 
\begin_inset Formula $l=\left(a,b,c\right)$
\end_inset

 and a parallel line 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{\prime}=\left(a,b,c^{\prime}\right)$
\end_inset

, both intersects 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(b,-a,0\right)$
\end_inset

.
 As the line's direction varies, the ideal point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(b,-a,0\right)$
\end_inset

 varies over 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
 In

\begin_layout Proposition
Duality principle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
To any theorem of 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

-dimensional projective geometry, there corresponds a dual theorem, which
 may be derived by interchanging roles of points and lines in the original
 theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Separator plain
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proof of hte dual theorem will be the dual of the proof of the original
 theorem.
 Once the original theorem has been proved, it is not necessary to prove
 the dual of a given theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Conics and dual conics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2D projective geometry, all non-degenerate conics are equivalent under
 projective transformations.
 The homogeneous form of a conic can be obtained by replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}/x_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}/x_{3}$
\end_inset

, resulting in 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\boldsymbol{x}^{T}C\boldsymbol{x}=0
\]

\end_inset

where the conic coefficient matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
C=\begin{bmatrix}a & b/2 & d/2\\
b/2 & c & e/2\\
d/2 & e/2 & f
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conic 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is more properly termed a 
\emph on
point 
\emph default
conic, a sit defines an equation on points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conic has five degrees of freedom 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a\colon b\colon c\colon d\colon e\colon f\right\} $
\end_inset

 or equivalently the six elements of a symmetric matrix less one for scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
A conic is determined uniquely (up to scale) by five points in general position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of fitting a geometric entity or relation by determining a null
 space is frequently used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
The line 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 tangent to a conic 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{x}$
\end_inset

 is given by 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{l}=C\boldsymbol{x}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The line passes through 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{x}$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
l^{T}x=x^{T}Cx=0.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
If 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 has one point contact with the conic, then we are done with the proof.
 Otherwise it meets the conic at another point 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{T}Cy=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{T}Cy=l^{T}y=0.$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(x+\alpha y\right)^{T}C\left(x+\alpha y\right)=0\quad\text{for all }\alpha.
\]

\end_inset

which means the whole line 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 lies on the conic 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

, which is degenerate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Separator plain
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
If the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is not of full rank, then the conic is termed degenerate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Separator plain
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Degenerate point conics include two lines (rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

), and a repeated line (rank 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the duality result, it is not surprising that there is also a conic
 which defines an equaiton on lines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
Dual conics, 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{*}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
A line 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 tangent to the conic 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{T}C^{*}l=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the adjoint matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.

Dual conics are also called conic envelopes because of tangent lines.

\begin_layout Standard
2D proejctive geometry is the study of properties of the projective palen

\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
projectivity/collineation/projective transformation/homography
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
A projectivity is an invertible (nonsingular) mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}^{2}$
\end_inset

 to itself s.t.
 three points

 lie on the same line iff 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x_{3}\right)$
\end_inset

 do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Projectivities form a group since the inverse of a projectivity is also
 a projectivity, and so is the composition of two projectivities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "thm:non-singular matrix for projectivity"

\end_inset

A mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $h\colon\mathbb{P}^{2}\to\mathbb{P}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is a projectivity iff there exists a non-singular 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 s.t.
 for any point in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}^{2}$
\end_inset

represented by a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 it is true that 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(\vec{x}\right)=H\vec{x}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any invertible linear transformation of homogeneous coordinates is a projectivit
y.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{3}$
\end_inset

 lie on a line 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{T}x_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2,3$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 be a non-singular 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{T}H^{-1}Hx_{i}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the points 
\begin_inset Formula $Hx_{i}$
\end_inset

 all lie on the line 
\begin_inset Formula $H^{-1}l$
\end_inset

, and so collinearity is preserved by the transformation.
\end_layout

The converse is omitted since it is not provided in the book.

Note that the matrix
