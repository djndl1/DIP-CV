When UAV is getting close to the marker, the whole shape of the marker cannot appear in the image frame. The recognition should be maintained with some portion of the marker shape for an accurate autonomous landing. Due to the distortion of thelens and the attitude of the vehicle, circles may appear as ellipses. The ellipse fitting algorithm using Direct Least Square is expected to achieve the goal. Multiple ellipses are used to estimate the center of the marker with the navigation filter algorithm.
